( Input-pullup and "saturation"

  What is the read value of pin to which nothing is connected:
  LOW or HIGH?

  Actually it's fluctuating and things getting more funny when you
  attach wire to that pin. That wire will act like antenna.

  This is not always fun, so serious guys are adding resistor between
  V and pin. This way free pin will be HIGH any time.

  And connected pin can be pulled to LOW easily.


  But how to name it? Groking about this input-pullup (and "Tri-state"
  and "Hi-Z") required my efforts. Can we make it simpler?

  Initially I named this setting "Free pin value". Another names were
  "Default pin value" (but there is no fault) and "Idle pin value".

  But soon I've discovered there is no sense in "Free pin value = 0"
  -- pin value will just fluctuate.

  So analogy is inflated balloon. Or pressurized pipe. For some
  reason I chose word "saturated".

( Ports

  Pins are grouped in bit "ports". Pin requires three bits to
  configure and control it. So three different ports per 8 pins.

  Obvious design is use two bits per pin. One for read/write mode,
  other for getting/setting value.

  But not here. Here we have optional pull-up (which is always used
  anyway). Here we have separate port for reading and another for
  writing. And using writing port for input pin makes some additional
  useless magic things. Same as using reading port for output pin.

( No port A

  Yeah really, we have ports B C and D. No port A. Each "port" occupies
  three bytes and port B starts at address 0x23. So there probably
  is/was port A at address 0x20. I'll call this port Atlantis.
