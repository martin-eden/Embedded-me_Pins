  Input-pullup and "saturation"

  What is the read value of pin to which nothing is connected:
  LOW or HIGH?

  Actually it's fluctuating and things getting more funny when you
  attach wire to that pin. That wire will act like antenna.

  This is not always fun, so serious guys are adding resistor between
  V and pin. This way free pin will be HIGH any time.

  And connected pin can be pulled to LOW easily.


  But how to name it? Groking about this input-pullup (and "Tri-state"
  and "Hi-Z") required my efforts. Can we make it simpler?

  Initially I named this setting "Free pin value". Another names were
  "Default pin value" (but there is no fault) and "Idle pin value".

  But soon I've discovered there is no sense in "Free pin value = 0"
  -- pin value will just fluctuate.

  So analogy is inflated balloon. Or pressurized pipe. For some
  reason I chose word "saturated".
